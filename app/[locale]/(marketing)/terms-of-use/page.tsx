          Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain types of
          warranties or limitations on applicable statutory rights of a
          consumer, so some or all of the above exclusions and limitations may
          not apply to You. But in such a case the exclusions and limitations
          set forth in this section shall be applied to the greatest extent
          enforceable under applicable law.
