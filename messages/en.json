          "question": "What is HEIC format?",
          "answer": "HEIC (High Efficiency Image Container) is Apple's default image format since iOS 11. It saves about 50% storage space compared to JPEG while maintaining the same image quality."
        },
        "q2": {
          "question": "Why do I need to convert HEIC to PDF?",
          "answer": "While HEIC format works great on Apple devices, it has poor compatibility on other platforms (like Windows, Android). Converting to PDF ensures files can be viewed and shared on any device."
        },
        "q3": {
          "question": "Will conversion affect image quality?",
          "answer": "We use advanced conversion algorithms to maintain original image quality to the maximum extent. The converted PDF quality is virtually identical to the original HEIC file."
        },
        "q4": {
          "question": "Are there file size limitations?",
          "answer": "Free users can process files up to 10MB each, with batch upload supporting up to 5 files. For larger files or more quantity, you can upgrade to a paid plan."
        },
        "q5": {
          "question": "Are my files secure?",
          "answer": "Yes, we take user privacy very seriously. All files are transmitted via SSL encryption and automatically deleted within 3 hours after conversion. We don't save or share any of your files."
        },
        "q6": {
          "question": "How long does conversion take?",
          "answer": "Typically, the conversion process completes within 30 seconds. Actual time depends on file size and current server load. Batch conversions may take longer."

      "item1": {
        "question": "What is the HEIC format?",
        "answer": "HEIC (High Efficiency Image Container) is Apple's default image format introduced after iOS 11. It offers better compression and quality than JPEG, but has less universal compatibility than PDF."
      },
      "item2": {
        "question": "Why convert HEIC to PDF?",
        "answer": "Converting HEIC to PDF ensures your images can be viewed on any device or platform, making them easier to share, print, and archive. PDF is a universal format supported by virtually all devices and applications."
      },
      "item3": {
        "question": "What additional features does the Premium version offer?",
        "answer": "Our Premium version offers batch processing, watermark-free output, higher resolution, priority support, and faster conversion speeds. It's particularly suited for professionals and businesses that need to process large volumes of images."
      },
      "item4": {
        "question": "How can I get the best conversion quality?",
        "answer": "For best conversion quality, ensure you upload original HEIC files rather than compressed versions, select appropriate conversion settings, and consider using our Premium version for higher quality output."
      },
      "item5": {
        "question": "What are the limitations of the free version?",
        "answer": "The free version limits you to 5 conversions per day, with a maximum file size of 10MB each, and includes watermarks on the output PDFs. Your free usage count resets at the beginning of each month, allowing you to continue using our basic service."
      },
      "item6": {
        "question": "How can I get online support?",
        "answer": "You can reach out to our support team at support@heictopdf.com. We offer 24/7 support, with Premium users enjoying priority response service."
