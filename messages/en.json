        "q1": {
          "question": "What is HEIC format?",
          "answer": "HEIC (High Efficiency Image Container) is Apple's default image format since iOS 11. It saves about 50% storage space compared to JPEG while maintaining the same image quality."
        },
        "q2": {
          "question": "Why do I need to convert HEIC to PDF?",
          "answer": "While HEIC format works great on Apple devices, it has poor compatibility on other platforms (like Windows, Android). Converting to PDF ensures files can be viewed and shared on any device."
        },
        "q3": {
          "question": "Will conversion affect image quality?",
          "answer": "We use advanced conversion algorithms to maintain original image quality to the maximum extent. The converted PDF quality is virtually identical to the original HEIC file."
        },
        "q4": {
          "question": "Are there file size limitations?",
          "answer": "Free users can process files up to 10MB each, with batch upload supporting up to 5 files. For larger files or more quantity, you can upgrade to a paid plan."
        },
        "q5": {
          "question": "Are my files secure?",
          "answer": "Yes, we take user privacy very seriously. All files are transmitted via SSL encryption and automatically deleted within 3 hours after conversion. We don't save or share any of your files."
        },
        "q6": {
          "question": "How long does conversion take?",
          "answer": "Typically, the conversion process completes within 30 seconds. Actual time depends on file size and current server load. Batch conversions may take longer."
