## Introduction

Have you ever faced this hassle: You take stunning photos on your iPhone, only to find out that you can't open them on your Windows computer, or you can't upload them to certain websites? This kind of compatibility headache is especially common when transferring images between Apple devices and Windows PCs or web apps.

The culprit is the HEIC image formatâ€”a cutting-edge, efficient format popularized by Apple. While HEIC saves space without sacrificing quality, it simply doesn't play well with most non-Apple ecosystems (especially Windows and many web platforms). The best and most universal solution is to convert your HEIC images to PDF, a format that everyone can open anywhere.

Don't worry! This article is your comprehensive, step-by-step, all-platform guide to converting HEIC to PDFâ€”whether you're on iPhone, Mac, or Windows, you'll find the perfect solution for your needs. Let's get started!

## Solution One: Convert Directly on iPhone/iPad

### Method A: Use the "Print" Function (Best for Single or Few Images)

Few people realize that iOS's built-in "Print" feature can natively convert images to PDF. Here's how:

1. Open the Photos app and select one or more HEIC images.

2. Tap the "Share" button in the lower-left corner.

3. Scroll down in the share menu and tap "Print."

4. On the print preview screen, perform a two-finger "pinch-out" gesture on the photo preview. This will instantly turn the preview into a PDF.

5. Tap the "Share" button in the upper right, then choose to save your new PDF to the Files app, iCloud Drive, or share it via Email, Messages, etc.

> **Note:** This method requires no extra apps and is perfect for a few images, but isn't ideal for bulk conversion or organizing multiple images.

---

### Method B: Online Tool (Best for Batch Merging & Sharing)

If the previous steps seem cumbersome, or you need to handle dozens of HEIC photos and combine them into a single, orderly PDF (like for travel albums or work reports), our online converter is your fast-track to efficient conversion:

1. Open our website in Safari or any browser on your iPhone or iPad.
2. Tap the upload button and select the HEIC photos you want to convert (multiple selection supported).
3. (Optional) Drag images to reorder before merging.
4. Tap the "Convert" button and wait a few seconds.
5. Tap "Download PDF"â€”the file will be saved straight to the Files app, ready for sharing or export.

**Key Advantages:** Effortlessly batch-convert and merge photos into a PDF with zero learning curveâ€”perfect for organizing albums, documentation, or sharing with others.

## Solution Two: Easy Conversion on Mac

### Method A: Use the Built-in "Preview" App (macOS Preferred)

For Mac users, the easiest way is via the Preview app, which natively supports exporting and merging HEIC images into PDFs:

1. Select your HEIC files on your Mac and double-click to open them in Preview.

2. If you have multiple images, select them in the thumbnail sidebar.
3. Go to the top menu, choose "File" > "Export as PDF..."
4. Name your file, select a save location, and click "Save."

---

### Method B: Right-Click "Quick Actions" (Fastest for Single Image)

macOS also allows lightning-fast conversion for single files via Quick Actions:

1. In Finder, select your HEIC photo and right-click.
2. Choose "Quick Actions" > "Create PDF."

> **Limitation:** This only works for single files and can't merge multiple images. For batching, use Method A or our online tool.

## Solution Three: Convert on Windows 11/10 (Biggest Compatibility Pain Point)

### First: Make Windows Recognize HEIC

By default, Windows can't open HEIC files. Here's what you need to do:

1. Open the Microsoft Store, search for "HEIF Image Extensions", and install it (it's free).
2. Once installed, the Windows Photos app can now read HEIC images.

---

### Method A: Use the Photos App with "Microsoft Print to PDF"

1. After installing the HEIF extension, double-click the HEIC file and open it with the Photos app.
2. Click the printer icon in the upper right, or press "Ctrl + P".
3. In the print dialog, select "Microsoft Print to PDF" as the printer.
4. Adjust settings like orientation, then click "Print". The system will ask you to save the generated PDF.

> **Pain Point:** While this approach is native and reliable, you have to process images one by oneâ€”merging is not possible, making it tedious for many files.

### Method B: Online Tool (Best Choice for Windows Users)

- **No installation or plugins required**â€”just open your browser!
